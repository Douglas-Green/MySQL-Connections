# Database Connection and Query Execution

### connection.js is a JavaScript file that was created with the intentions of showcasing how we can create connections to our MySQL databases and query that database using Nodejs. I didn’t create the file for anyone to install and run the file. It is just a simple educational resource or reference for anyone who needs a quick way to remember how to craft a robust connection on the fly. Comments are in-depth for the most part with highlights on the key parts of the actual code spots for anyone just learning this tech stack. I hope this file helps someone out there in the vast realm of the internet. If you have any feedback or criticism feel free to reach out to me my info is below. Thanks!



F.Y.I. If you do plan on using any of the functions with the conenctions.js file please don’t forget that you have to import at the top of the file that you want to use the connection in. This is a really easy step to forget so I thought I would just quickly mention it so your coding education and  progress has one less roadblock placed in front of you! Cheers!

```javascript
import { queryDatabase } from './connections.js';

queryDatabase();
```
